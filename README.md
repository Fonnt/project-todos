# Project Todos

Build an application that pulls together all the parts of redux by building a todo app.

## The problem

Started this project by doing research about how already donde todo list works. Created a figma file with inspo and breaked down the different parts and what components needed to be created.

I used Redux-toolkit in order to achieve and show:

- A list of all tasks - completed or uncompleted.

- Be able to mark an uncompleted task as complete (and change it back to uncompleted).

- Be able to add and remove tasks.

- Show a count of all todos and all uncompleted todos.

I also developed:

- A filter that filters all tasks, completed tasks and uncompleted tasks.
- A clear all button.
- Local storage that saves info

If I would have more time I would probably have implemented:

- A button to mark all tasks as checked and unchecked.
- Worked more with the styling, introducing some animations and hovers.
- A label filter to assign categories to the different tasks.
